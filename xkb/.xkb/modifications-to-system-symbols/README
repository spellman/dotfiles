I tried making custom keymaps and symbols to go on top of the system stuff, as per http://madduck.net/docs/extending-xkb/ and other links in my Chrome bookmarks folder "Keyboard Key Mapping"/"xkb keyboard config". Did not work for me under Linux Mint 14 on October 9, 2014.

Therefore, I modified the following system symbol files instead:
/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/
                           altwin
                           altwindefault
                           pc
                           pcdefault

The symbols/ directory contained in this directory has copies of the modified versions of the above files.
